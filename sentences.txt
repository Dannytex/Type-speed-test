The rabbit of Easter. He bring of the chocolate.

Inside, the fireplace is brightly lit, and the Yule log crackles with orange and crimson sparks.

There’s a steaming mug in your hands, warming your fingers.

Kindness is like snow. It beautifies everything it covers.

Take a break and chill because this is the time of the year to rejoice, celebrate and also feel rewarded.

Winter is the time for comfort, for good food and warmth, for the touch of a friendly hand and for a talk beside the fire.
